# My Project

## Code Integration Workflow

1. Commit code changes to your own branch.

2. If you are behind master (or whatever branch you intend to merge your code to), then pull
    that branch into your branch.  `git pull origin branch-name`

    * Resolve any conflicts.  Commit and push again.

3. Create a pull request

4. Request a review from a team member if applicable.

5. Once ready for integration, merge pull request.


Notes:

1. Work in your own branch.
2. Commit frequently, pull master frequently.
3. Merge code whenever stable.
4. When encountering conflicts, work with team members to resolve.
5. Write good commit comments. Describe features in Pull Requests.
6. Comment your code, describe what it does. Clarify intent.
